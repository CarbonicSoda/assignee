\section{Introduction}
\label{overview.intro}

This report concerns Assignee, a full stack web application for the ICT SBA task
of implementing an assignment system.

In this chapter, we would cover the capabilities of Assignee users, and the core
systems of design that would guide later sections. At the end of the chapter, we
would provide resources for reference and validation.

\section{User Capabilities}
\label{overview.capab}

This section aims to describe the roles of different users of Assignee and what they
can accomplish via the app. The section would be a high level overview of user
workflow, thus omitting other capabilities such as those related to accessibility,
which would be covered in later chapters.

Symbolic notes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Role inheritance is denoted by $Child \in Parent$

	\item Role transitions are denoted by $Old \xrightarrow{Transition}New$
\end{itemize}

Role inheritance means all actions that could be done by the role $Parent$ could
be done by the role $Child$. A role transition happens when the user with the role
$Old$ performs a certain action and thus attains the $New$ role.

Capabilities marked with a dagger \textdagger{} are not implemented in the
actual application, at least in initial versions. This is primarily because they
have lower priority, but details would be given as needed.
