\section{Introduction}
\label{overview.intro}

This report concerns Assignee, a full stack web application for the ICT SBA task
of implementing an assignment system.

In this chapter, we would cover the capabilities of Assignee users, and the core
systems of design that would guide later sections. At the end of the chapter, we
would provide resources for reference and validation.

\section{User Capabilities}
\label{overview.capab}

This section aims to describe the roles of different users of Assignee and what they
can accomplish via the app. The section would be a high level overview of user
workflow, thus omitting other capabilities such as those related to accessibility,
which would be covered in later chapters.

Symbolic notes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Role inheritance is denoted by $Child\in{}Parent$

	\item Role transitions are denoted by $Old\xrightarrow{Transition}New$
\end{itemize}

Role inheritance means all actions that could be done by the role $Parent$ could
be done by the role $Child$. A role transition happens when the user with the role
$Old$ performs a certain action and thus attains the $New$ role.

Capabilities marked with a dagger \textdagger{} are not implemented in the
actual application, at least in initial versions. This is primarily because they
have lower priority, but details would be given as needed in paragraphs starting
with daggers.

\subsection{User System}
\label{overview.capab.user}

Roles: $(Visitor, User)$

\begin{samepage}
	$Visitor$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $Visitor\xrightarrow{Signup}User$

		\item $Visitor\xrightarrow{Signin}User$
	\end{itemize}
\end{samepage}

\begin{samepage}
	$User$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Change sign-in email

		\item Change sign-in password

		\item Change display name

		\item Change other settings \textdagger{}

		\item $User\xrightarrow{Signout}Visitor$

		\item $User\xrightarrow{Delete}Visitor$
	\end{itemize}
\end{samepage}

The very basics of the application is the user system which manages user
accounts. An account can be identified by an email and verified by a password,
like any well-known websites.

People nowadays almost definitely owns an email (which obviously holds for students/employers
with school-/corp-domain emails). Therefore, visitors do not need to spend time thinking
of unique names for sign-up but to use their email right away. They can set
custom display names that resonate with them later.

\textdagger{} Other settings are not implemented in initial versions. For one, Assignee
is rather opinionated, with everything tuned for the good. For two, the
complexities of Assignee in its current phase is low, writing one would over-complicate
the app. However, the database table for it would still be given in later chapters
for reference of potential implementation.

%MO TODO move to other chapters/sections, doesnt fit here
% \textdagger{} Albeit using password solely can harm security, email 2FA is abandoned
% so that reviewers can run the app without access to email API keys, which would
% otherwise pose security threats. The database table for it would still be included
% in later chapters for reference, having simple implementations available for
% actual deployments.
