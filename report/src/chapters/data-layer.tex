\chapter{Data Layer}
\label{data-layer}

\section{Introduction}
\label{data-layer.intro}

Backing the application is the data layer, featuring a database to preserve user
data efficiently.

In this chapter, we would first go through the design of the relational database
and provide rationales behind those design choices. Later, we would cover the actual
implementation of the database in more detail.

\section{Design}
\label{data-layer.design}

In this section, we discuss the design of tables, fields, and their data types.
We also explore the relational mappings of tables and fields from multiple
perspectives. Besides, we will also delve into the adoption of normal forms.

The design of the database follows the blueprint outlined in
\hyperref[overview.capab]{Capabilities}, centering the core systems and their related
roles.

If not otherwise specified, all table fields are Not Null. This prevents database
inconsistency from having Null entries, reduces the risks of anomalies, and simplifies
backend application logic dealing with the database.

It should be noted prior that SQLite is used to implement the database, so that
the database file could be self-contained and ported for inspection. Since there
are no data type modifiers e.g. int(n), unsigned or char(n) in SQLite (all which
are stored variably internally), we only describe the data type of fields with
general classes. However, constraints e.g. email length limits will still be mentioned
for reference of application logic or other DMBS implementations in paragraphs starting
with daggers.

\subsection{User System}
\label{data-layer.design.user}

The user system serves as the backbone of the entire application, responsible for
storing user account-related data. It encompasses user identifiers, authentication
data and user preferences \textdagger{}.

The system consists of the following tables:

\begin{itemize}
	\item User: User account identifiers

	\item Password: User sign-in password

	\item Session: User active sessions

	\item Authcode \textdagger{}: User 2FA codes

	\item Preference \textdagger{}: User preferences
\end{itemize}

As seen in \autoref{fig:data-layer.user-system}.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includesvg[width=0.75\linewidth]{assets/data-layer/user-system}
	\caption{User System ER Diagram}
	\label{fig:data-layer.user-system}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Relations}
\label{data-layer.design.user.rels}

User - Password (One-To-One)
\begin{itemize}
	\item A user owns a single password (Mandatory)

	\item A password has a single owner (Mandatory)
\end{itemize}

User - Session (One-To-Many)
\begin{itemize}
	\item A user can have many sessions (Optional)

	\item A session is for a single user (Mandatory)
\end{itemize}

User - Authcode (One-To-One) \textdagger{}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A user has at most one valid code (Optional)

	\item An authcode is for a single user (Mandatory)
\end{itemize}

User - Preference (One-To-One) \textdagger{}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A user owns a set of preferences (Mandatory)

	\item A preference is for a single user (Mandatory)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tables}
\label{data-layer.design.user.tables}

\paragraph{User}
\S{} \label{data-layer.design.user.tables.user}

\subparagraph{uid}
(Integer) (Auto-Increment) (Primary Key)
\label{data-layer.design.user.tables.user.uid}

Although User.email is a candidate key for the table, User.uid is chosen as the
primary key for several reasons, considering that the table will be referenced a
lot:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Space Efficient: Tables reference users with integer instead of text

	\item Index Performant: Indexing is faster in magnitudes with integers

	\item Consistent: Auto-increment primary keys are consistent throughout

	\item Flexible: Flawless even if one day email login is no longer used
\end{itemize}

This applies to all auto-increment primary keys in the database and shall not be
mentioned again.

\textdagger{} In other DBMS, integers can be defined with fixed bit-width. In practical
applications, 32-bit integers would be more than suffice, holding up to $2^{32}=4
,294,967,296$ users, which is over half of the world population. Setting it to unsigned
would enforce consistency and prevent failures in application logic due to wrapped
negative numbers, ensuring reliability. This is not a concern in SQLite.

\subparagraph{email}
(Text) (Unique) \label{data-layer.design.user.tables.user.email}

The email address used for sign-up/in is necessarily unique.

\textdagger{} In other DBMS, text can be varchar with max length. To accommodate
the flexible length of email addresses, it should be capped to 254 characters in
ASCII, this is to align with the standards outlined in RFC 5322: Internet Message
Format. This is not a concern in SQLite.

\subparagraph{name}
(Text) \label{data-layer.design.user.tables.user.name}

The arbitrary display name users may choose.

\textdagger{} In other DBMS, text can be varchar with max length. To ensures the
display name will not be too long for display and not too short for personalization,
It is capped to 30 characters in UTF-8 encoding, to encompass usernames in different
languages or even emojis. This is not a concern in SQLite.

\subparagraph{created/updated}
(DateTime) \label{data-layer.design.user.tables.user.meta}

Metadata fields that record the creation/update time of entries for internal
validation.

\textdagger{} In other DBMS, 64-bit integers can be used instead of datetime if
the available datetime type or timestamp type is prone to the Y2K38 Problem, either
due to the DBMS being outdated or runs on a 32-bit OS. Bigint could also be
preferred if cross-DBMS compatibility is required. However, dealing with UNIX
timestamps in form of bigint adds complexities to application logic, requiring middlewares
to handle datetime conversion. The same applies for other datetime fields
mentioned. This is not a concern in SQLite.

The fields are also present in other tables (either one may be omitted depending
on the context). Unless they serve a special purpose elsewhere, they will not be
mentioned again.

\paragraph{Password}
\S{} \label{data-layer.design.user.tables.pswd}

\subparagraph{uid}
(Integer) (Primary Key) (Foreign Key -
\hyperref[data-layer.design.user.tables.user.uid]{User.uid}) \label{data-layer.design.user.tables.pswd.uid}

Foreign key referencing password owner, at the same time serves as the primary key,
since it is a one-to-one map.

\subparagraph{hash/salt}
(Blob) \label{data-layer.design.user.tables.pswd.crypt}

Blob refers to Binary Large Object, a blob in SQLite is roughly equivalent to bytes
in other DBMS.

Storing authentication related data in raw form is not a good idea. Instead, the
raw data is hashed using cryptographically secure hashing algorithms and stored in
digest form, which is impossible to crack in polynomial time. To verify input data,
hash the input with the same algorithm and compare against the stored hash.

However, relying on the hash alone is vulnerable to rainbow table attacks, thus
a salt is needed. A salt is a random binary generated with a cryptographically secure
pseudo-random number generator seeded with enough entropy, which would be
concatenated to the key (in byte buffer form) before hashing. The salt will be stored
directly in the database along with the hash, as having the salt will not
provide any help in attempt to crack the key.

Given a key, a salt would be generated, which is appended to the key in byte
buffer form. Then the byte buffer would be hashed, and the digest would be
stored in the database together with the salt. On attempt to verify an input against
the key, the whole procedure would be repeated but with the salt from the
database. It would suffice to check if the digest matches the one stored.

Assignee uses a variable digest length hashing function K12 (KangarooTwelve) based
on Keccak-p, instead of the traditional SHA-256 hash which is weaker than K12 in
cryptanalysis. Assignee uses 128-bit salts and 256-bit digests for the procedure.

It is actually possible for hashes to collide for different input. But in our
case the chance is vanishingly low: you will need a minimum of $1.5\cdot{}10^{31}$
items before having a less than $10^{-15}$ chance of collision, even without
salts. This is to be ignored in practice.

Stored as blob is to prevent bytes from being trimmed silently by other data types,
and it is simply more convenient and conventional to do so.

\textdagger{} In other DBMS, hashes and salts can be stored in fixed length
binaries, since they will always be of the same length i.e. 32-bytes and 16-bytes.
This is not possible in SQLite.

Hashes and salts are used in all authentication related tables in the database,
and shall not be detailed again. For this specific case, the key that is hashed
is simply the user password.

\paragraph{Session}
\S{} \label{data-layer.design.user.tables.sess}

\subparagraph{sid}
(Integer) (Auto-Increment) (Primary Key)
\label{data-layer.design.user.tables.sess.sid}

Since the user-session relation is one-to-many, the foreign key Session.uid
cannot be used as the primary key. The benefits of such a primary key had already
been mentioned.

\subparagraph{uid}
(Integer) (Foreign Key - \hyperref[data-layer.design.user.tables.user.uid]{User.uid})
\label{data-layer.design.user.tables.sess.uid}

The referential key to User.uid, representing the session bearer.

\subparagraph{hash/salt}
(Blob) \label{data-layer.design.user.tables.sess.crypt}

This part is about the design of the authentication process specific to a
session. For the reasons of using a hash/salt pair, refer to
\hyperref[data-layer.design.user.tables.pswd.crypt]{Crypt}.

When a user is logged-in, a bearer token consisting of a session identifier and a
token string. The session identifier is unique globally, and the token string is
a random hex string of specific length.

The token would then be serialized and stored as a browser cookie with an expiration
date. On the server side, a hash/salt pair would be generated with the key being
the concatenation of the bearer token string and the browser metadata e.g.
browser type and device OS, to ensure invalidation if token is migrated to other
locations.

Upon log-in attempt, the token cookie would be checked. If it is still active,
it would be retrieved and hashed to compare with the stored version. If the hashes
match, the user would be logged-in and handed a new bearer token, and the old token
would be invalidated. Also, the expiry of the session would be checked prior with
respect to the session creation date, so it would not be possible to use an
expired token.

The session token would also be validated against upon certain CRUD API requests
to prevent unauthorized access.

\paragraph{Authcode \textdagger{}}
\S{} \label{data-layer.design.user.tables.code}

\subparagraph{uid}
(Integer) (Foreign Key - \hyperref[data-layer.design.user.tables.user.uid]{User.uid})
\label{data-layer.design.user.tables.code.uid}

The referential key to User.uid, representing the authcode requestor.

\subparagraph{hash/salt}
(Blob) \label{data-layer.design.user.tables.code.crypt}

Refer to \hyperref[data-layer.design.user.tables.pswd.crypt]{Crypt}, the process
mentioned is identical to the one used except that the key is the authcode instead
of the password.

\textdagger{} Using password solely harms security, but email 2FA is still abandoned
so that reviewers could run the app without access to my personal email API keys,
otherwise posing privacy and security threats on leakage. The implementation of the
process would still be mentioned in the application layer for reference of actual
deployments.

\paragraph{Preferences \textdagger{}}
\S{} \label{data-layer.design.user.tables.pref}

\subparagraph{uid}
(Integer) (Foreign Key -
\hyperref[data-layer.design.user.tables.user.uid]{User.uid}) \label{data-layer.design.user.tables.pref.uid}

The referential key to User.uid, representing the preference owner.

\subparagraph{override}
(JSON) \label{data-layer.design.user.tables.pref.override}

The method used to store custom settings is through overrides. Given the global
default settings e.g. ( a: 0, b: true, c: ( x: "foo" ) ), the users settings are
stored as overrides e.g. ( b: false, c: ( x: "bar" ) ). Merge the overrides into
the defaults to get the complete setting i.e. ( a: 0, b: false, c: ( x: "bar" ) ).

This use of JSON has several benefits:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Space Efficient: Only store settings user altered

	\item Flexible: Default settings could be updated freely

	\item Organization: Settings sectioning is always implied
\end{itemize}

Using JSON values is sort of against 1NF (first normal form) that it stores
multiple attributes in the same field, but as scholars had argued, values in 1NF
are allowed to be arbitrarily complex objects. A table in 1NF would need as many
columns as there are settings, and nesting settings for sectioning would not be
possible. This arguable compromise is preferred for its great efficiency and flexibility.

\textdagger{} In other DBMS, JSON values might not be supported. But since JSON
could be easily serialized into string

\textdagger{} This table is not implemented in initial versions, since Assignee is
highly opinionated in style, and we cannot see the necessity of implementing a
settings feature.

\subsubsection{Indexes}
\label{data-layer.design.user.indexes}

Some tables in Assignee owe one-to-one relations and would not need additional indexing.
However, some tables owe many-to-one relations, thus their foreign keys are
indexed to ease relational item gathering.

Unlike obsolete binary search based index taught in textbooks, modern DBMS typically
uses B-Trees for indexing, which is a self-balancing data structure. Unlike BST indexes
with O(n) time complexities, which also require index reconstruction on insertion
or deletion; B-Trees allow O(logn) operations, and index reconstruction is not
necessary. This implies that in modern DBMS indexes are very cheap and the overhead
of adding indexes is staggeringly small.

The same applies for other systems e.g. indexing foreign keys, and details on indexes
shall only be given in later sections if it is used for other purposes.

\subsubsection{Normal Forms}
\label{data-layer.design.user.normals}

Practical databases adopt normal forms partially. Certain compromises could enhance
performance and even flexibility e.g. the arguable JSON usage.

All tables in Assignee abide normal forms as much as they could, with a few exceptions.
For instance, the classic JSON for preference case. The separation of e.g. Password
from i.e. User even though they could be in the same table without violating
normal forms, is to keep separate table metadata i.e. update timestamps for
security monitoring. It also implies more flexibility to addition of user-related
data.

Most tables abide the same guidelines: 3NF/4NF, and only minimal exceptions for practical
purposes. This shall not be mentioned again in later systems for brevity.
