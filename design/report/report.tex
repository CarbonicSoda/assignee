\chapter{Overview} \label{overview}



\section{Project Objectives} \label{overview.project-objectives}
The following pages provide a brief overview of user capabilities by role.
We have three core systems - User, Team, and Assignment - designed to manage complex application logic, as detailed below.
\br
Notes:\n
Only workflow-related points are included; GUI aspects are excluded.\n
Each task is described broadly (e.g., login), with detailed information provided later in the report.
\br
Symbolic Notes:\n
...... $\rightarrow$ \{A\}: The user performing the action attains role A.\n
\{B\} $\rightarrow$ \{C\}: The action allows a user with role B to attain role C.\n
\{D\} $\in$ \{E\}: Role D inherits from role E, granting users with role D all permissions of role E.


\subsection{User System} \label{overview.project-objectives.user-system}
Roles: \{Site Visitors\}, \{Logged-in Users\}\n
\begin{itemize}
	\item \{Site Visitors\}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Register for accounts;\null\hfill $\rightarrow$ \{Logged-in Users\}
		      \item Log in to existing accounts;\null\hfill $\rightarrow$ \{Logged-in Users\}
	      \end{itemize}
	\item \{Logged-in Users\}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Change password;
		      \item Change username or email;
		      \item Modify other settings;
		      \item Log out;\null\hfill $\rightarrow$ \{Site Visitors\}
		      \item Delete account;\null\hfill $\rightarrow$ \{Site Visitors\}
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}\n
The User System is a standard account management system found in web applications.
It allows visitors to create accounts, while registered users can log in and manage their account settings.
\br
Authentication techniques are implemented to support this system, with detailed information provided in later chapters.
\br
The User System is central to all components of this application,
including the \S \hyperref[overview.project-objectives.team-system]{Team System},
the \S \hyperref[overview.project-objectives.assignment-system]{Assignment System},
and any future systems that may be introduced,
such as a Posts and Comments System or an Instant Messaging System using P2P WebRTC or C/S WebSockets.


\subsection{Team System} \label{overview.project-objectives.team-system}
Roles: \{Users\}, \{Team Members\}, \{Team Monitors\}, \{Team Owners\}\n
\begin{itemize}
	\item \{Users\}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Join teams;\null\hfill $\rightarrow$ \{Team Members\}
		      \item Create teams;\null\hfill $\rightarrow$ \{Team Owners\}
	      \end{itemize}
	\item \{Team Members\} $\in$ \{Users\}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Leave the team;\null\hfill $\rightarrow$ \{Users\}
		      \item Comment on messages*;
	      \end{itemize}
	\item \{Team Monitors\} $\in$ \{Team Members\}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Invite team members;\null\hfill \{Users\} $\rightarrow$ \{Team Members\}
		      \item Kick team members;\null\hfill \{Team Members\} $\rightarrow$ \{Users\}
		      \item Post messages*;
	      \end{itemize}
	\item \{Team Owners\} $\in$ \{Team Monitors\}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Change team name;
		      \item Change team description;
		      \item Appoint team monitors;\null\hfill \{Users\} $\rightarrow$ \{Team Monitors\}
		      \item Remove team monitors;\null\hfill \{Team Monitors\} $\rightarrow$ \{Users\}
		      \item Delete the team;\null\hfill $\rightarrow$ \{Users\}
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}\n
Similar to Google Classroom, users can create or join teams,
with team owners having the ability to appoint or remove team monitors to assist in managing the team.
Additionally, roles within the hierarchy can manage members and perform team actions to varying degrees and extents.
\br
The *post and comment features are not implemented in the initial version of the web app, as they are considered a lower priority.
If these features are added later, they will be decoupled from the current system.
\br
The Team System is central to the \S \hyperref[overview.project-objectives.assignment-system]{Assignment System}.


\subsection{Assignment System} \label{overview.project-objectives.assignment-system}
Roles: \{Team Owners\}, (\{Team Members\},) \{Assignees\}\n
\begin{itemize}
	\item \{Team Owners\}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Author assignments;
		      \item Add attachments to assignments;
		      \item Assign assignments;\null\hfill \{Team Members\} $\rightarrow$ \{Assignees\}
		      \item Revoke assignments;\null\hfill \{Assignees\} $\rightarrow$ \{Team Members\}
		      \item Grade, comment on, and return submissions;
	      \end{itemize}
	\item \{Assignees\} $\in$ \{Team Members\}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Submit assignments;
		      \item Add attachments to submissions;
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}\n
The Assignment System is the core feature we are tasked with completing. The system operates intuitively:\n
Team owners can assign assignments to selected team members with a deadline.
Assignees can draft and submit their work.
After submission, the team owner can grade the assignment, provide comments, and return it to the assignee.
\br
An attachment system is designed to manage attachment files,
enabling team owners and assignees to add additional files to their assignments and submissions without needing to reattach all previous files after exiting.
More details will be provided in later chapters.



\section{Miscellaneous} \label{overview.miscellaneous}


\subsection{Folder Structure} \label{overview.project-structure.folder-structure}
To maintain a clear separation of concerns and promote modularity, the web application is divided into three layers,\n
Data Layer: Manages data storage and retrieval;\n
Application Layer: Contains the business logic and processes data;\n
Presentation Layer: Handles user interface and user interaction;
\br
This organization can be observed in the project folder structure.
While the folder structure may undergo frequent changes, its fundamental layout will remain consistent across revisions.
\newpage
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{minipage}{0.3\linewidth}
		\dirtree{%
			.1 /.
			.2 design/.
			.3 database/.
			.3 report/.
			.2 site/.
			.3 backend/.
			.3 frontend/.
		}
	\end{minipage}
	\caption{Overall Folder Structure}
	\label{fig:overview-folder-structure}
\end{figure}
\br
The design/ directory contains files that are not part of the actual web application.
This includes the report, media assets used in the report, and other related documents.
\br
Notes:\n
The database/ directory corresponds to the Data Layer.
It is located under design/ because the hosted database is independent of the site/ folder (linked only via the database URL in the .env file).
Only the distribution .sql file used to instantiate the database is stored here.
Further details can be found in the chapter \S \hyperref[data-layer]{Data Layer}.
\br
The directory backend/ corresponds to the Application Layer.
Further details can be found in the chapter \S \hyperref[application-layer]{Application Layer}.
\br
The directory frontend/ corresponds to the Presentation Layer.
More information is provided in the chapter \S \hyperref[presentation-layer]{Presentation Layer}.


\subsection{Repository} \label{overview.project-structure.repository}
The entire project folder is hosted in a repository available at
\href{https://github.com/CarbonicSoda/assignee}{GitHub/Carbonic\-Soda/assignee (github.com/CarbonicSoda/assignee)} for inspection.
\br
With GitHub, we can review all past commits from the start of this project to the latest update or patch.
This functionality not only facilitates version control and debugging but also enables simultaneous work on the back-end and front-end through branching.




\chapter{Data Layer} \label{data-layer}
This chapter covers the design and implementation of the supporting relational database.
\br
In \S \hyperref[data-layer.design]{Design}, we discuss the design of tables, fields, and their data types, along with the rationales behind these choices. We also explore the relational mappings of tables and fields from multiple perspectives. Finally, we will delve into the adoption of normal forms in greater detail.
\br



% In the section \hyperref[data-layer.implementation]{Implementation}
\section{Design} \label{data-layer.design}
The design of the relational database follows the blueprint outlined in the section \S \hyperref[overview.project-objectives]{Project Objectives}.
The three core systems and their related entities (roles) are utilized to structure and populate the database.
\br
Notes:\n
Throughout the database, snake\_case is used for table and field names, in contrast to conventional practices of using CONSTANT\_CASE.
This choice helps distinguish entities from SQL commands, which are typically written in uppercase.


\subsection{User System} \label{data-layer.design.user-system}
The User System serves as the backbone of the entire web application, responsible for storing user account-related data.
This system encompasses user identifiers, authentication data and user preferences.
\br
The User System consists of five tables, as described below,
\begin{itemize}
	\item users: Contains user account identification information;
	\item authcodes: Holds user email authentication codes;
	\item passwords: Manages user password information;
	\item sessions: Tracks user browser sessions;
	\item preferences: Stores user preferences;
\end{itemize}
Relations:\n
A \{user\} can only have a single valid email \{authcode\} at a time;\null\hfill (Optional)\n
An email \{authcode\} is for one \{user\} only;\null\hfill (Mandatory)
\br
A \{user\} can only have a single \{password\};\null\hfill (Mandatory)\n
A \{password\} is for a single \{user\};\null\hfill (Mandatory)
\br
A \{user\} can have many \{sessions\} at the same time;\null\hfill (Optional)\n
A \{session\} is borne by one \{user\} only;\null\hfill (Mandatory)
\br
A \{user\} can only have a single set of \{preferences\};\null\hfill (Mandatory)\n
A set of \{preferences\} is owned by a single \{user\};\null\hfill (Mandatory)
\br
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{user_system.jpeg}
	\caption{User System ER Diagram}
	\label{fig:user-system-er}
\end{figure}
\br
Rationales and more details on table fields are given below.\n
Notes:\n
When not otherwise specified (Null-able), all table attributes are defined as Not Null.
This approach is taken to prevent potential issues related to database consistency that can arise from having Null entries.
It reduces the risk of anomalies and simplifies backend application logic dealing with complicated queries.

\subsubsection{Table - users} \label{data-layer.design.user-system.users}
In Assignee, users can register for accounts using their email addresses.
The email address acts as the unique identifier for user login.
This approach simplifies the process, eliminating the need for users to create a username,
as their email is readily available for use.\n
While logging in with their email addresses, users can choose their own display names for better identification.
These display names do not need to be unique, allowing users the flexibility to select names that resonate with them.
\br
- uid (Unsigned BIGINT) (Auto-Increment) (Primary Key)\n
Although \{email\} is a candidate key for the table, \{uid\} is chosen as the primary key for several reasons:\n
\begin{itemize}
	\item Storage Efficiency: Tables referencing a user can save on storage space by using a BIGINT instead of a VARCHAR.
	\item Indexing Performance: Indexing this frequently accessed table is typically faster with a BIGINT.
	\item Consistency and Flexibility: Using an auto-increment primary key helps maintain database consistency and flexibility, especially if there comes a time when email login is no longer used.
\end{itemize}\n
BIGINT is set to be unsigned to maintain consistency across the application.
This approach prevents potential issues in backend logic that could arise from wrapped negative numbers,
ensuring stability and reliability in data handling.
\br
- email (ASCII VARCHAR(254)) (Unique)\n
The email address used for account registration and login is defined as VARCHAR type in the database schema, necessarily unique.
This choice accommodates the flexible length of email addresses.\n
VARCHAR is capped to 254 characters in ASCII, this is to align with the standards outlined in
\href{https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322}{RFC 5322: Internet Message Format}
\footnote{Refer to www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322.}.
\br
- name (UTF-8 VARCHAR(30))\n
The arbitrary display name users may use.
It is of UTF-8 encoding to encompass usernames in different languages or even emojis.
Capped to 30 characters, this ensures the username will not be too long for display yet not too short for personalization.
\br
- created \& updated (Unsigned BIGINT)\n
Metadata fields for table. They record the time the entry is created / updated.\n
Instead of DATETIME or TIMESTAMP, BIGINT is used for several reasons:
DATETIME is dependent on the database used, i.e. MySQL and might not be cross-database compatible.
TIMESTAMP stores UNIX timestamps which is indeed what we want to store,
but is signed 32-bit integer in MySQL and is thus prone to the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem}{Y2K38 Problem}
\footnote{Refer to en.wikipedia.org\-/wiki/Year\_2038\_problem.}.
By using middlewares in backend API handling this problem can be mitigated.
Details in \S \hyperref[application-layer.design.middlewares]{Middlewares}.
The attribute(s) also exist in other tables, unless something is special about it, they will not be otherwise mentioned.

\subsubsection{Table - authcodes} \label{data-layer.design.user-system.authcodes}
Upon user registration or log-in (contexts that require better authentication) an authcode would be sent via email.
(Or phone just in case email login is no longer used, this is an example of the benefit of using \{uid\} as primary key for \{users\})
\br
- uid (Unsigned BIGINT) (Primary Key) (Foreign Key $\rightarrow$ users.uid)\n
Only a single email authcode would be valid for a user at a time,
before sending a new authcode in backend the old one (if exists) would be deleted.
Therefore, uid is sufficiently unique as the primary key of the table.\n
There will be a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron}{Cron Job}
\footnote{Refer to en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron.}
to remove expired authcodes from the database,
with expiry calculated with \{created\} + \{Some Time e.g. 10 minutes\},
in interval of an hour or alike defined in backend.
When a user attempts to use an authcode, the backend will also check if it expired.\n
The relation mapping between \{authcodes\} and \{users\} has ON DELETE: CASCADE,
which will remove all entries in \{authcodes\} with authcodes.uid = users.uid upon deletion of a \{users\} entry automatically,
preventing anomalies on entry deletion.
This together with ON UPDATE: RESTRICT, which restricts updating referenced field,
is applied to all relations in the database and will not be mentioned again otherwise.
\br
- hash (BINARY(32)) \& salt (BINARY(16))\n
Storing authentication related information in raw form is not a good idea, i.e. password or authcode.
Instead, the raw data is hashed using
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function}{Cryptographically Secure Hashing Algorithms}
\footnote{Refer to en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic\_hash\_function.}
and stored in digest form.
Hashes are practicably impossible to crack reversely in reasonable polynomial time.
On attempt to verify input data, it is hashed again with the same algorithm and compared with the stored hash.\n
The only reason the hash is stored in BINARY is that the algorithm used returns a byte buffer directly, and it is simply more convenient to do so.
A variable digest length hashing function
\href{https://keccak.team/kangarootwelve.html}{K12}
\footnote{Refer to keccak.team/kangarootwelve.html.}
is used instead of traditional SHA-256, which is weaker than K12 in cryptanalysis.\n
However, storing only the hash is vulnerable to
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table}{Rainbow Table Attacks}
\footnote{Refer to en.wikipedia.org\-/wiki/Rainbow\_table.},
thus a salt is needed. A salt is a BINARY generated with a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator}{Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator}
\footnote{Later abbreviated as CSPRNG. Refer to en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically\_secure\_pseudorandom\_number\_\-generator.}
with enough entropy, that is concatenated to the raw string (in byte buffer form) before hashing.
It is of length 16 bytes in our case which is totally sufficient for the purpose.
The salt will be stored directly in the database along with the hash,
as having the salt will not provide any help in attempt to crack the original string.\n
To summarize, given a raw string as input, a random salt of 16 bytes would be generated,
appended to the raw string after converting it into byte form.
After which the resulting byte buffer is hashed with K12 into a 256-bits digest and stored in the database together with the salt.
When a user attempts to verify his input against the correct one,
his input would be appended with the salt stored in the database and hashed with K12 again,
to check if the resulting digest matches with the stored hash.\n
Technically there is a chance for hashes to collide with each other with different input,
but in the case of using a 32 bytes digest with salt in use, the chance would be vanishingly low
\footnote{The collision chance calculation method used in this report: \href{https://stackoverflow.com/a/62667633}{Probability of Hash Collision on StackOverflow}. Refer to stackoverflow.com/a/62667633.}:
you would need roughly $10^{31}$ items before having n approximate $10^{-15}$ chance of collision even without salts.\n
Hash + salt is used in all authentication related tables in the database, and will not be detailed again otherwise.
However, more information could be found in
\S \hyperref[application-layer.implementation.authentication]{Application Layer - Authentication} and
\S \hyperref[security.authentication]{Security - Authentication}.

\subsubsection{Table - passwords} \label{data-layer.design.user-system.passwords}
\br
- uid (Unsigned BIGINT) (Primary Key) (Foreign Key $\rightarrow$ users.uid)\n
The uid of user that owns the password.
\br
- hash (BINARY(32)) \& salt (BINARY(16))\n
Hash and salt of the user password.
\br
- updated (Unsigned BIGINT)\n
Will also be used to track how long it was since the user last changed his password.

\subsubsection{Table - sessions} \label{data-layer.design.user-system.sessions}
To keep user logged-in in certain scenarios, browser sessions must be used.
Many browser sessions can exist at the same time for the same user.
When a user chose to stay logged-in, a bearer token of form
\{ uid: int, token: string \}
will be generated,
uid being the uid of the session bearer, and
token being a random binary number generated by a CSPRNG in hex representation.
The token will then be serialized and stored in the browser cookie for the site having an expiry date itself.\n
The hash will be created from a concatenation of (browser info + device info etc.) + token + salt.
Upon attempt to log in to a session,
for all sessions with sessions.uid = bearer\_token.uid,
expiry would be checked in backend with respect to \{created\}.
Then, if one is still active, the current browser info etc. would be retrieved and concatenated with bearer\_token.token,
hashed with salt and compared with the stored hash.
If matched, the user would be logged-in and handed a new bearer token (old one would be deleted), renewing session expiry.
More details will be handed in \S \hyperref[application-layer.implementation.authentication]{Application Layer - Authentication} and
\S \hyperref[security.authentication]{Security - Authentication}.
\br
- uid (Unsigned BIGINT) (Primary Key) (Foreign Key $\rightarrow$ users.uid)\n
The uid of the session bearer.
\br
- hash (BINARY(32)) \& salt (BINARY(16))\n
Hash and salt of the reinforced session token.

\subsubsection{Table - preferences} \label{data-layer.design.user-system.preferences}
- uid (Unsigned BIGINT) (Primary Key) (Foreign Key $\rightarrow$ users.uid)\n
The uid of the user that has the preferences.
\br
- override (JSON)\n
The user would be allowed to override default settings and the overridden ones would be specified in this JSON object.
For instance, if the default settings are \{ a: 1, b: \{ c: true \}, d: "h" \},
and the user only alters settings.b.c, the JSON object would be like \{ b: \{ c: false \} \}.\n
This is against 1NF (actually it might not be, as argued below) in return of way greater flexibility and storage efficiency.
Imagine a few other settings are added, a table in 1NF would need more columns to deal with this.
However with our methodology, upon addition of new settings, they would automatically be the default values waiting for the user to override.
Also, nesting settings would not have been possible in 1NF.
Only storing overridden settings will save a lot of storage space and is flexible in the long term.\n
It is worth mentioning that this may not be a violation of 1NF at all.
Scholar C. J. Date has argued that values can be arbitrarily complex objects
\footnote{Date, C. J. (2007). What First Normal Form Really Means.}.
But this is open to interpretations.\n
Notes: JSON is supported by all major DBMS nowadays. If somehow not, JSON could be easily serialized into string and stored as TEXT instead.

\subsubsection{Indexes} \label{data-layer.design.user-system.indexes}
Most of the tables in the User System have one-to-one relations with \{users\},
so would not need additional indexing.
However, \{sessions\} and \{users\} have a many-to-one relation.
To easily retrieve all sessions owned by a user, sessions.uid is indexed.\n
It is worth mentioning that unlike the obsolete binary search based index taught in textbooks, modern DBMS typically uses
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree}{B-Trees}
\footnote{Refer to en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree.}
for indexing, which is self-balancing.
That means, unlike binary search based indexes that would require rebuilding the index from scratch on insert / delete,
or BST-based indexes with $O(n)$ worst case time complexities for search / insert / delete,
it would only require at most $O(logn)$ in any scenario.
Implication is that in modern DBMS, indexes are way cheaper and the overhead of adding many indexes is staggeringly small.\n
Thus, in other systems that require more indexes, the trade-off of indexing would not be discussed as it is trivial.
Only the use case of the indexes would be covered otherwise.


\subsection{Team System} \label{data-layer.design.team-system}
The Team System is built upon the \S \hyperref[data-layer.design.user-system]{User System} to store teams related information.
This system contains team identification and invitation data,
whilst also keeping track of team monitor appointments.
\br
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{team_system.jpeg}
	\caption{Team System ER Diagram}
	\label{fig:team-system-er}
\end{figure}
\br
The Team System encompasses five tables,
\begin{itemize}
	\item users: \S \hyperref[data-layer.design.user-system.users]{User System - users};
	\item teams: Contains team details;
	\item invitations: Holds team invitation codes;
	\item memberships: Stores user memberships of teams;
	\item appointments: Manages team monitor appointments;
\end{itemize}
\br
Table relations:\n
A \{user\} can create and own many \{teams\} at the same time;\null\hfill (Optional)\n
A \{team\} is owned by one \{user\} only;\null\hfill (Mandatory)
\br
A \{team\} can only have a single active \{invitation\} code;\null\hfill (Optional)\n
An \{invitation\} code is for a single \{team\};\null\hfill (Mandatory)
\br
A \{user\} can have many \{memberships\} at the same time;\null\hfill (Optional)\n
A \{membership\} is for a single \{team\} only;\null\hfill (Mandatory)
\br
A \{team\} can own many \{memberships\} at once;\null\hfill (Optional)\n
A \{membership\} is of one \{user\} only;\null\hfill (Mandatory)
\br
A \{user\} can be in many \{appointments\};\null\hfill (Optional)\n
An \{appointment\} is for a single \{team\} only;\null\hfill (Mandatory)
\br
A \{team\} can have many \{appointments\} at once;\null\hfill (Optional)\n
An \{appointment\} is of one \{user\} only;\null\hfill (Mandatory)
\br
Rationales and more details on table fields are given below.

\subsubsection{Table - users} \label{data-layer.design.team-system.users}
Refer to \S \hyperref[data-layer.design.user-system.users]{User System - users}.

\subsubsection{Table - teams} \label{data-layer.design.team-system.teams}
Users in assignee are allowed to create and own an arbitrary amount of teams.
This is slightly isomorphic to Google Classroom or Discord.
\br
- tid (Unsigned BIGINT) (Auto-Increment) (Primary Key)\n
Users should not have to waste time thinking of a unique team ID,
instead when they create a team an auto-increment tid would be given to the team,
and users may use whatever team name they want without worrying about uniqueness.
\br
- owner\_uid (Unsigned BIGINT) (Foreign Key $\rightarrow$ users.uid)\n
The uid of the owner of the team.
\br
- name (UTF-8 VARCHAR(30))\n
The arbitrary name of the team.
It is of UTF-8 encoding to support team names in different languages and emojis etc.
Capped to 30 characters ensures the team name will not be too long for display yet not too short for identification.
\br
- description (UTF-8 VARCHAR(80))\n
The detailed description of the team displayed less prominently.
It is of UTF-8 encoding to support different languages and emojis etc.
Capped to 80 characters to promote clarity and facilitate display.

\subsubsection{Table - invitations} \label{data-layer.design.team-system.invitations}
Users can only become members of a team through invitations.
In assignee, invitations take the form of codes.
\br
- tid (Unsigned BIGINT) (Primary Key) (Foreign Key $\rightarrow$ teams.tid)\n
A team can only have one active invitation code at once.
Before getting a new invitation code, in backend the old one (if exists) would be deleted.
Therefore, tid is sufficiently unique as the primary key of the table.\n
There will be a cron job to remove expired invitation codes from the database,
with expiry calculated with \{created\} + \{Some Time e.g. 24 hours\},
in interval of a day or alike defined in backend.
When a user attempts to use an invitation code, the backend will also check if it expired.\n
\br
- code (BINARY(4)) (Unique)\n
The invitation code will be generated with a CSPRNG even though security is less of a concern here.
The invitation code must be unique, the choice between tid and code as the primary key is minor,
as code will be indexed too.\n
For a randomly generated code to be unique, newly generated codes must be checked to not exist in the table already,
otherwise it would be regenerated. But this will not be a problem.
For one, the field is indexed, so uniqueness checks would be efficient;
For two, the chance of collision using a 4 bytes binary code is vanishingly low:
with $10,000$ codes in the table, a new code will only have a rough $0.01$ chance of colliding.
There must be approximately $100,000$ codes in the table before a collision must happen.
(Of course, if you deem that a small number,
making codes BINARY(5) would increase that number to $1,500,000$).\n
The code, when displayed in the application or inputted,
would be in hex representation e.g. A1B2FFCA.
A few good things about this is: 1. easy to generate and transform;
2. hex strings only have the characters 0-9 A-F, which will not be hard to distinguish, unlike 0 and O;
So they could be easily memorized.

\subsubsection{Table - memberships} \label{data-layer.design.team-system.memberships}
A linking table for users' memberships in teams.
Users in assignee are allowed to join an arbitrary amount of teams and vice versa.
\br
- tid (Unsigned BIGINT) (Composite Primary Key) (Foreign Key $\rightarrow$ teams.tid)\n
The tid of the team that the membership involves.
\br
- uid (Unsigned BIGINT) (Composite Primary Key) (Foreign Key $\rightarrow$ users.uid)\n
The uid of the user that is member of the involved team.

\subsubsection{Table - appointments} \label{data-layer.design.team-system.memberships}
A linking table for teams' monitor appointments.
Teams in assignee can appoint an arbitrary amount of teams monitors and vice versa.
\br
- tid (Unsigned BIGINT) (Composite Primary Key) (Foreign Key $\rightarrow$ teams.tid)\n
The tid of the team that appoints a team monitor.
\br
- uid (Unsigned BIGINT) (Composite Primary Key) (Foreign Key $\rightarrow$ users.uid)\n
The uid of the appointed team monitor of the team.

\subsubsection{Indexes} \label{data-layer.design.team-system.indexes}
All foreign key fields are automatically indexed by MySQL.
Besides that, for tables with a composite primary key i.e. linking tables,
the proper subset of the composite key excluding the primary one will also be indexed.
For example, in \{memberships\}, the primary key index is (tid + uid).
This key can be used to speed up operations on (tid + uid) and \{tid\} alone,
as \{uid\} is only taken into consideration if \{tid\} is identical when sorting
\footnote{The order of keys in indexes does matter, but many ignore this fact.}.
However, \{uid\} alone cannot benefit from this index, and an additional index on \{uid\} must be added.
This way, no matter we are searching for a specific record, group by a team or group by a user,
an index will always be available at hand.\n
Also, unique fields are also indexed i.e. invitations.code for fast lookup and existence checks.
Otherwise, the foreign key indexes in the system are utilized for query grouping
\footnote{Indexes on foreign keys are mandatory in MySQL for optimization, here we discuss how they may be useful.},
e.g. index on teams.owner\_uid to retrieve all teams owned by a user.


\subsection{Assignment System} \label{data-layer.design.assignment-system}
The Assignment System is the core system supported by all previous systems.
This system tracks assignment details and attachments.
It also manages assignee submissions and attachments.
\br
The Assignment System contains six tables, as described below.\n
Notes: only relations related to this system would be shown,
e.g. users.uid - teams.owner\_uid will not be shown as it is irrelevant to assignments.
\begin{itemize}
	\item teams: \S \hyperref[data-layer.design.team-system.teams]{Team System - teams};
	\item assignments: Holds team assignment details;
	\item assignment\_attachments: Stores assignment attachments;
	\item users: \S \hyperref[data-layer.design.user-system.users]{User System - users};
	\item submissions: Manages assignee submission details;
	\item submission\_attachments: Contains submission attachments;
\end{itemize}

\br
Relation mappings:\n
A \{team\} can post any amount of \{assignments\};\null\hfill (Optional)\n
An \{assignment\} is issued by a single \{team\};\null\hfill (Mandatory)
\br
An \{assignment\} may have many \{assignment\_attachments\};\null\hfill (Optional)\n
An \{assignment\_attachment\} is for a single \{assignment\};\null\hfill (Mandatory)
\br
An \{assignment\} can be assigned for many \{submissions\} (to assignees);\null\hfill (Optional)\n
A \{user\} can be assigned to many \{submissions\} (as assignee);\null\hfill (Optional)\n
A \{submission\} is only for one \{assignment\};\null\hfill (Mandatory)
\br
A \{submission\} may contain multiple \{submission\_attachments\};\null\hfill (Optional)\n
A \{submission\_attachment\} is only for one \{submission\};\null\hfill (Mandatory)
\br
They will be justified below.

\subsubsection{Table - teams} \label{data-layer.design.assignment-system.teams}
Refer to \S \hyperref[data-layer.design.team-system.teams]{Team System - teams}.

\subsubsection{Table - assignments} \label{data-layer.design.assignment-system.assignments}
Teams in assignee are allowed to post assignments to a selection of their team members.
This specific table holds the verbal details and the deadline of assignments.
\br
- aid (Unsigned BIGINT) (Auto-Increment) (Primary Key)\n
Teams shall not waste any time thinking for a unique assignment ID themselves.
\br
- tid

%MO TODO discuss NFs, also + uid&email business etc.
% \subsection{Miscellaneous}
%MO TODO reason why views / triggers etc. are not implemented




% The table is separated from the \{user\} table, even not violating any normal forms (at least up to 3NF),
% is to separate different concerns and better time-stamping (with separated \{updated\}) for security issues investigation.
